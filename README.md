# What This Is

This is just a simple app to play with Vue, Vite, TailwindCSS and some images.

The guys over at blocktools.deep-orbit.com/ made these amazing guides. I wanted
an easy way to use them, and wanted to be able to click between the guides I wanted to see.

So I took the chance to play around with some resources I haven't touched in a while... and
here's the simple result.

### Setup and run

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

And then connect to localhost:3000
